# COVID-19 Genome Sequences Analysis



### This reposiroty contains the COVID-19 genome sequences that are stored in the datasets folder.

### Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) techniques are used on the COVID-19 genome sequences to find frequent nucleotides patterns in the sequence, relationship of frequent patterns and prediction of nucleotides in the sequence.
